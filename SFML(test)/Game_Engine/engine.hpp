/*
This header file declares a class Engine that contains static member functions for initializing, updating, rendering, and cleaning up the game engine, as well as a static member function that returns a reference to the main window. Keep in mind that, 

These examples are just a simple example and there are many ways to organize and optimize a game engine depending on the needs of the specific game.
